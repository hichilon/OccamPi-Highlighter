occam-pi is a concurrent programming language using the process-oriented programming model, which aims to make it straightforward to write correct, expressive concurrent programs. occam-pi is supported on a variety of platforms by a collection of open source tools, and is used and maintained by a community of developers around the world.

##Learning Resources 
[occam-pi](http://pop-users.org/occam-pi/LearningResources/) - the occam-pi home page (which you can get to quickly by going to http://occam-pi.org/)

[concurrency.cc](http://concurrency.cc/) - currently the home page for occam-pi on the Arduino, the long-term plan is to make concurrency.cc the main collection of resources for programming in occam-pi and related languages.

[KRoC](http://projects.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/kroc/trac/) - the KRoC home page. KRoC is the suite of software that contains most of the occam-pi development tools and libraries; this site has information on how to install KRoC.

[Transterpreter](http://www.transterpreter.org/) - Transterpreter - home page for the Transterpreter (a portable occam runtime for small devices that's now included with KRoC).
